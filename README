NAME
    scron - Supervised Cron

DESCRIPTION
    Cron is great for routine tasks on a single machine where one person is
    the sysadmin. When you begin to have a multi-admin environment, with
    hundreds of machines, and you need to keep track of vital routine jobs,
    cron fails to live up to the task.

    scrond, a supervised cron daemon, calls cron-like commands, storing the
    output of the command and notifying admins about potential error
    conditions and states. It expands the cron toolset by allowing one to
    specify how long a process is expected to take, what the error condition
    is expected to be, and other similar controls. It allows one to keep
    closer track on cron jobs.

USAGE
    See the man page for scrond for detailed usage.
